Data, glorious data. 

Data = Singal + Noise

Goal of the predictor: find the signal, ignore the noise. 

Garbage in = Garbage out

Issues to consider and trade-offs

1. Interpretable
2. Simple
3. Accurate
4. Fast
5. Scalable (Why Netflex never used the algorithm that won its $ 1M prize)

In sample error (resubstitution error): Errors on the training set that we built with. The data we have.
Out of sample error (generalization error): Errors on the data set that wasn't used to train the predictor. The data we don't have but want to predict. 
Importance: Out > In

Overfitting: Sometimes, simple rules do better than complicated rules
